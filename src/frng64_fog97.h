/*  Generation of a random double precision number by creating a 52 bits fractional
		part at random and setting the biased exponent to -1023 to get a float in
		`[1,2)`, then subtracting 1 from it to get a float in `[0,1)`.

		The method is described by [Saito and Matsumoto](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04107-5_38) and linked to a work by 
		Agner Fog in 1997. They note that it can also be used to compute a number 
		in (0,1] by performing 2‚àíùëü instead of ùëü‚àí1. 
		Though it is not said by Saito and Matsumoto, the subtraction ùëü‚àí1 is errorless 
		thanks to Sterbenz's theorem. The method is also discussed in 
		Numerical Recipes in FORTRAN 77, Second Ed., 1992, p. 275.

		The same method is used by [Nicolau Werneck ](https://xor0110.wordpress.com/2010/09/24/how-to-generate-floating-point-random-numbers-efficiently/)  to generate random floating-point numbers in [‚àí1,1]
