@chapter What is FPNGlib?
@c ======================

FPNGlib is a C library that offers pseudo-random generators in a unified framework. As the name implies, its strong point is the availability of many IEEE@tie{}754 floating-point random number generators, with the possibility to control the kind of floating-point number generated (e.g., the amount of subnormal vs. normal) and their properties (e.g., probability of having a least significant bit of the fractional part to be @math{1})

Even though it is entirely written in ISO Standard C99, FPNGlib is, at present, only supported on UNIX-like systems (GNU/Linux and Mac@tie{}OS@tie{}X are the only two tested environments) due to the tools used for its configuration, compilation and deployment (@emph{autotools}).

@chapter Getting Started with FPNGlib
@c ==================================

This chapter describes the very first steps with FPNGlib, from the retrieval of the archive for the library to the first program you will write to test its potential. If you are accustomed to work with autotools-based software, feel free to proceed directly to Section@tie{}@ref{An Introduction to FPNGlib}.

@section Installation
@c ------------------
The FPNGlib library uses the @emph{autotools} (@url{https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/,autoconf}, @url{https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/,automake}, @url{https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/,libtool}) for configuration, compilation, and deployment. However, these tools do not need to be present on your computer as long as you do not modify the configuration files (@file{configure.ac} and the various @file{Makefile.am} files).

The library is entirely written in the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 C language. Therefore, it requires a decently recent C compiler such as any GNU C Compiler v.@tie{}4.5 or higher.

In order to test the library, you will need to install @command{check} v. 0.11.0 or higher (@url{https://libcheck.github.io/check/}) beforehand. If your compiler does not support
the macro @code{__VA_OPT__}, some tests will not be performed. That macro should be
available in GCC version 8 and above, and in Clang version 6 and above.

Before compiling the library, you need to configure it. It is done by calling the command @command{./configure} in the root directory of FPNGlib. The command accepts many options, among them:

@itemize @w{}
@item @option{--help}: displays a list of all the options available;
@item @option{--prefix=@var{<path to install into>}}: gives the path to install the code into. The header files will go into an @file{include/} subdirectory, while the library will go into a @file{lib/} subdirectory;
@item @option{--enable-debug=@var{[yes/info/profile/no]}}: define whether the code should be compiled with debugging information and assertion support. The default is @samp{yes}.
@end itemize
There are many other options, shared by all autotools-based applications. Use @command{./configure --help} to get the complete list.

Once the configuration is complete, you may call @command{make} in the root directory of the distribution for FPNGlib to compile the library.

After having compiled the library, you should test it, in order to ensure that everything is ok. This is done by calling @command{make check}. If no error is detected, you may proceed to the installation phase.

The library should be installed before being used. However, if you want to get a taste of it beforehand, you may modify and execute the examples in the sub-directory @command{examples/} even before the installation. Calling @command{make} in this directory will recompile the necessary files.

The installation is done by calling @command{make install}. Provided you did not override the default locations during the configuration process, the library will be installed into @file{/usr/local}.

@node An Introduction to FPNGlib
@section An Introduction to FPNGlib
@c --------------------------------
FPNGlib offers generators for random integers and random IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. We will first see how to obtain random integers in @ref{Generating Random Integers} and @ref{Generating Random Integers in a Domain}, and then random floats in @ref{Generating Random Floating-Point Numbers} and @ref{Generating a random float with some properties}.

@node Generating Random Integers
@subsection Generating Random Integers
@c ...................................
Our very first program using FPNGlib simply draws one integer at random:

@cartouche
@verbatiminclude snippets/isimple.c
@end cartouche

Assuming you have installed FPNGlib locally in some directory @file{$HOME/local} by configuring it with the command @samp{./configure --prefix=$HOME/local}, you may compile the example above by calling @command{gcc} as such:

@example
gcc -I$HOME/local/include -L$HOME/local/lib \
      -o simple simple.c -lfpnglib
@end example
@cindex Compiling with libfpnglib.so

Of course, if both the @emph{include} directory and the @emph{lib} directory paths appear in the relevant environment variables (@env{C_INCLUDE_PATH} and @env{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}, respectively), you may dispense entirely with the @code{-I} and @code{-L} directives.
Alternatively, as long as you work on the example file provided in the distribution of the library, you may simply call @command{make simple} to compile it.

The output of this program should be:
@verbatim
3340206418
11203470090111516746
@end verbatim

In the above example, we use the 32 bits version of the Mersenne Twister MT19937@footnote{@url{http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/ARTICLES/earticles.html,@cite{Mersenne Twister: A 623-dimensionally equidistributed uniform pseudorandom number generator, M. Matsumoto and T. Nishimura. ACM Trans. on Modeling and Computer Simulation, 8(1), 1998.}}}, but FPNGlib also offers the 64 bits version, declared in @file{fpnglib/mt19937-64.h}.

Random integers come in two sizes: 32 bits and 64 bits. As exemplified in the example above, both sizes may be created by 32 bits generators and 64 bits ones: A 32 bits generator will combine two outputs to return a 64 bits integer; on the other hand, a 64 bits generator will usually split its output into two 32 bits integers and return one of them to produce a 32 bits integer.

All Random Number Generators (@dfn{RNG}) may be initialized by a single integer, the @emph{seed}. In addition, some may be initialized by other means, mostly vectors of integers. It is the case with the Mersenne Twister MT19937, of which an instance may be created with the @code{fpngl_mt19937v32_by_array} function instead of @code{fpngl_mt19937v32}. Both functions return a pointer to an object of the opaque type @code{fpngl_irng32_t}. Since the implementation of that type is not public, all object of the type must be manipulated through pointers only. This is the rule for all other RNG types in FPNGlib.

By calling the function @code{fpngl_irng32_next32}, we compute the next 32 bits
integer. When calling the function @code{fpngl_irng32_next64}, the next two 32 bits integer are computed and combined to produce one 64 bits integer.

The call to @code{fpngl_mt19937v23} allocates some memory from the heap to represent the internal structure of the MT19937 RNG. We need to call @code{fpngl_irng32_delete} to reclaim that memory as soon as the RNG is no longer used.

@node Generating Random Integers in a Domain
@subsection Generating Random Integers in a Domain
@c ...............................................
A 32 bits RNG will usually draw an integer in the domain @math{[0,2^{32}-1]} or in some other smaller but still impractically large domain. More often than not, simulations require drawing integers in some precise domain, say @math{[1,6]} to simulate a dice, for example. For such an application, many sources still suggest to draw an integer in the full domain of the RNG and then use the modulo to restrict the output to the correct domain:
@cartouche
@verbatiminclude snippets/biased_dice.c
@end cartouche

However, since @math{2^{32} = 6\times 715827882 + 4}, there are @math{715827883} ways to produce the numbers @math{1} to @math{4}, and only @math{715827882} ways to produce the numbers @math{5} and @math{6}, which introduces a @math{1.397\times 10^{-7}}% bias. A very small bias indeed, but one that could become significant if one used a different RNG, such as a @emph{Linear Congruential Generator}@footnote{@cite{@url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator}}.} with a congruence much smaller than @math{2^{32}}.

With FPNGLlib, the proper way to generate a random integer in the domain @math{[0,k]}, is to use the @code{fpngl_ubound32} or @code{fpngl_ubound64} functions available in @file{fpnglib/irange.h}, depending on the type of RNG used:

@cartouche
@verbatiminclude snippets/dice.c
@end cartouche
Remember that the function @code{fpngl_mt19937v32} creates a 32 bits RNG with type @code{fpngl_irng32_t}. The @code{fpngl_ubound32} function computes a random integer in @math{[0,k-1]}, given @math{k} as its second argument. However, it must accept to do so with both a 32 bits RNG and a 64 bits RNG. We therefore need to encapsulate the actual 32 bits RNG into a ``generic'' RNG of type @code{fpngl_irng_t} with the function @code{fpngl_irng_new32}. The @code{irng} variable owns the 32 bits RNG it encapsulates and is responsible for its deletion, which will be done when we call @code{fpngl_irng_delete} instead of @code{fpngl_irng32_delete}. 

The @code{fpngl_ubound32} function uses the modification by O'Neill@footnote{@i{Efficiently Generating a Number in a Range}, Melissa E. O'Neil, @url{https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/bounded-rands.html}, 2018.} of Lemire's algorithm@footnote{@i{Fast Random Integer Generation in an Interval}, Daniel Lemire, ACM TOMACS 29(1), 2019.} to draw integers in an interval. The @code{fpngl_ubound64} uses the same algorithm, provided a 128 bits integer type
is available on the platform used. Otherwise, it uses slower methods presented by O'Neill at @url{https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/bounded-rands.html}.

To draw integers from a domain @math{[a,b]} instead of @math{[0,k]}, one can use the functions @code{fpngl_range32} and @code{fpngl_range64}. 

@node Generating Random Floating-Point Numbers
@subsection Generating Random Floating-Point Numbers
@c .................................................
One of the strong points of FPNGlib is the generation of IEEE@tie{}754 floating-point numbers@footnote{@i{IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic. IEEE STD 754-2008}. IEEE Computer Society, 2008.} (@dfn{floats}, for short). It offers many methods to draw floats in different domains and with various properties.

In the following example, we use the same RNG as the one used for @code{java.util.Random} in Java@tie{}8 to compute one double precision floating-point number in @math{[0,1)}:

@cartouche
@verbatiminclude snippets/fsimple.c
@end cartouche

The output expressed using the C99 hexadecimal format@footnote{See Section 6.4.4.2 of @i{ISO/IEC 9899:1999}.} is ``@code{0x1.314880e9bdp-10}.''

Floating-point number generators (@dfn{FRNG}s, for short) are either of the type @code{fpngl_frng32_t} when they produce single
precision floats, or @code{fpngl_frng64_t} for double precision. In the same way as for integer generators,
floats generators can only be manipulated through pointers to objects of these types. Any generator of either type must implement the same functionalities. In particular, as shown in the example below, double precision generators must implement the following calls:
@itemize
@item @code{fpgnl_frng64_name()}: returns a constant string corresponding to the name of
      the generator;
@item @code{fpngl_fnrg64_nextf64()}: returns the next double precision random number;
@item @code{fpngl_frng64_delete()}: reclaims the memory used to represent the generator.
@end itemize
As a consequence, it is possible to write functions requiring random floats independently of the FRNG actually used, and to pass it as a parameter (see, e.g., @code{mcpi} in @ref{exa:mcpi}).

Note, however, that FRNGs are not bound to return floats in any prescribed domain: some may return values in @math{[0,1)}, some in @math{(0,1)}, and some others in any other domain. It is then the responsibility of the programmer to choose FRNGs according to the domains they are interested into.

A classical way to implement FRNGs is to rely on an integer RNG and divide its output by
some integer constant, usually the largest possible integer the RNG can produce or the next integer above. This is what we do to create @code{frng0} in @ref{exa:mcpi}. Firstly, we create an IRNG based on the 32 bits version of the Mersenne Twister MT19937, then we create and FRNG by using the @code{fpngl_bydivision_new} constructor. That constructor takes three parameters:
@enumerate
@item A name for the newly created FRNG (``@code{FMT19937v32}'' in @ref{exa:mcpi});
@item An IRNG of the type @code{pfngl_irng_t};
@item A divisor by which each random integer should be divided (here, we choose to divide
      by the largest random number that our IRNG can produce, therefore creating a FRNG
      returning values in @math{[0,1]}).
@end enumerate

Note that, as is always the case in FPNGlib, the FRNG @code{frng0} created from the IRNG @code{irng32} ``owns'' it and is, therefore, responsible for its destruction. This is why we do not call @code{fpngl_irng_delete} at the end of the program: the call @code{fpngl_frng64_delete(frng0)} is sufficient to reclaim both the memory allocated to represent @code{frng0} and @code{irng32}.

The FRNG created with @code{fpngl_drand48bsd} also relies on the division of the result
of an LCG by a constant integer. The result is a floating-point number in @math{[0,1)} with 48 bits of entropy only.

@chapter General Organization of the Library
@c =========================================

In FPNGlib, all public constants, variables, types, and functions are prefixed with @samp{fpngl_} to make them stand apart in larger programs.
@cindex Prefix
 All header files from FPNGlib are in the directory @file{fpnglib/}.
 
All RNGs have types whose name is formed according to the same principle: first the prefix @samp{fpngl_}, then the type of the RNG (@samp{irng} for
an RNG generating integers, and @samp{frng} for an RNG generating floating-point
numbers) followed by the size of the values returned (@samp{32} for 32 bits integers and
single precision floating-point numbers, and @samp{64} for 64 bits integers and
double precision floating-point numbers), and finally the postfix @samp{_t} to mark the name as a type.
